# Next.js 15 Image Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when dealing with image imports that fail to load.  Specifically, it shows how an unhandled image error can break the entire application. The solution shows how to implement error handling to gracefully degrade the application.

## Bug
The `about.js` file attempts to render an image from a non-existent path. This results in an error that can disrupt the entire application.

## Solution
The solution involves using error handling, so that if an image fails to load, it gracefully defaults to a fallback image or a placeholder message, rather than crashing the whole application.
